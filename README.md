# Introduction

This project contains different Spring Boot BOMs created to simplify the developement of Microservice Spring application top of the Openshift/Kubenetes Cloud platform. They are used by our opinionated examples called boosters which contains Spring Java code implementing a pattern, use case or capability. Such booster will help you to develop Cloud Native application running on Openshift/Kubernetes.

A branch exists for each version of Spring Boot currently supported; 1.5.x, 2.x ...

To modify a pom, checkout the appropriate branch `git checkout sb-1.5.x`

# Releasing
